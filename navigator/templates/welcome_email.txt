Hi {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

Thanks for your interest in using AmCAT. We've created a new account for you on our server:

Please change your password as soon as possible.

*Caution: AmCAT3 is currently in alpha-testing stage.* Please make
sure that you do not rely solely on AmCAT for storing your data or for
meeting critical deadlines. Please report any bugs or other issues on
our issue tracker: http://code.google.com/p/amcat/issues/entry

We are working on creating user documentation for AmCAT3. The current
(very early) draft of this documentation is available at
http://amcat.vu.nl/plain/manual.pdf . This will be updated as we work
on the documentation. Consider subscribing to our user mailing list
(http://groups.google.com/group/amcat-user). This list will be used
for announcements from us on new versions or downtime, and you can
also use this list for asking user questions.

AmCAT is open source and all contributions are welcome! The full
source code can be downloaded from our our google projects page
(http://code.google.com/p/amcat/). This page also contains a developer
wiki with installation instructions. Feel free to ask any development
related questions on our developer mailing list
(http://groups.google.com/group/amcat-dev).

Good luck and kind regards,
The AmCAT team
