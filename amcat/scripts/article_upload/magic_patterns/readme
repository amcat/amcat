# These magic files are imported by the magic library
# For the file format specification, see `man magic`.
# The following convention is used for mime types that can directly be linked to an upload script plugin:
#    application/x.amcat-<scriptname>
#
# Mime types in this format are parsed by amcat, and the given script will be selected.
